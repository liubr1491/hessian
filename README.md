# Hessian
[hessian官网](http://hessian.caucho.com/)

关于Hessian的介绍， [维基百科](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_(Web_service_protocol)) 的说明如下：

> Hessian is a binary Web service protocol that makes Web services usable without requiring a large framework, and without learning a new set of protocols[weasel words]. Because it is a binary protocol, it is well-suited to sending binary data without any need to extend the protocol with attachments.

> Hessian was developed by Caucho Technology, Inc. The company has released Java, Python and ActionScript for Adobe Flash implementations of Hessian under an open source license (the Apache license). Third-party implementations in several other languages (C++, C#, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Objective-C, D, and Erlang) are also available as open-source.

# 本仓库介绍
由于 Hessian 并没有提供源码仓库，因此我将 [hessian源码](http://hessian.caucho.com/#Java) 解压后，源码整理到此仓库中。便于后续的学习。

解压的源码的jar包为目前hessian的最新版本：**hessian-4.0.60-src.jar**。
